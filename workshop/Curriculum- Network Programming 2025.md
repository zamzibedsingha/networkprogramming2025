Python Network Programming for Modern Networks
A weekly lab-based journey from classical sockets to future networks

Course Philosophy
Networks are not cables and boxes. They are agreements under uncertainty. Each week, you will build one agreement in Python—simple first, then fragile, then strange.
You already know IP addressing and routing. Now we program behavior.

## WEEK 1 – TCP Client–Server Communication (Unicast)

### Overview
This lab introduces socket programming through the most fundamental network model: client–server communication. One side listens. One side asks. Nobody panics.
Learning Outcome / Trait Assessment
Understand TCP client–server architecture
Implement blocking socket communication
Relate TCP reliability to application behavior
Traits: Structured thinking, protocol discipline, debugging network state
### Key Concepts
TCP sockets
Bind, listen, accept, connect
Request–response pattern
### Basic Lab Steps
Create a TCP server socket
Bind to a local port
Listen for incoming connections
Accept one client
Receive a message
Send a response
Close the connection
Students verify success using loopback (127.0.0.1).
### Expected Output
Client sends text → Server responds with acknowledgment
### Common Mistakes
Forgetting to listen()
Port already in use
Blocking forever on recv()
Future Extension
Add multiple clients (threading)
Add simple authentication
Transition to asyncio

### Extra Lab: Mini Chat Server

**Scenario**: Build a helpdesk chat server where multiple clients can connect sequentially.
**Real-world mapping**: Call centers, ticketing systems

## WEEK 2 – UDP Communication (Connectionless Unicast)

### Overview
This week removes the safety net. No connection. No guarantees. Just packets and hope.
Learning Outcome / Trait Assessment
Compare TCP vs UDP
Implement UDP sender/receiver
Observe packet loss behavior
Traits: Risk awareness, performance tradeoff analysis
BASIC LAB
Create UDP socket
Send datagram to receiver
Receive datagram
Print sender address
### Discussion Point
Why DNS, VoIP, and games choose UDP.
Future Extension
Add sequence numbers
Implement reliability manually

### Extra Lab: Sensor Data Stream

**Scenario**: Simulate IoT sensors streaming temperature data without retransmission.

## WEEK 3 – Broadcast Communication

### Overview
Broadcast is shouting. Useful. Dangerous. Educational.
### Learning Outcomes

- Understand LAN broadcast scope
- Implement broadcast discovery

### Basic Lab

- Enable broadcast socket option
- Send discovery message
- Receive broadcast on listener

### Real-World Usage
- DHCP
- Service discovery

### Future Extension
- Add discovery timeout
- Compare with multicast

### Extra Lab: Network Service Discovery Tool

Students build a tool that discovers active nodes on a LAN.

## WEEK 4 – Multicast Communication

### Overview
Multicast introduces group membership. You listen only if you care.
### Learning Outcomes

- Join multicast groups
- Differentiate multicast vs broadcast

### Basic Lab

- Join multicast address
- Send multicast message
- Receive group data

### Future Extension

- Video streaming simulation
- Pub/Sub model

### Extra Lab: Classroom Announcement System

One sender, many listeners, opt-in only.

## WEEK 5 – Peer-to-Peer Networking

### Overview
No server. Everyone pulls their own weight.
### Learning Outcomes

- Build symmetric network roles
- Handle dynamic ports

### Basic Lab

- Node acts as server and client
- Exchange peer messages

### Future Extension

- Peer discovery
- NAT discussion

### Extra Lab: File Sharing Prototype

Simulate BitTorrent-style peer exchange (no tracker yet).

## WEEK 6 – Ad-Hoc Networking (MANET)

### Overview
Infrastructure disappears. Nodes improvise.
### Learning Outcomes

- Simulate neighbor discovery
- Forward packets probabilistically

### Basic Lab

- Maintain neighbor table
- Forward packets with TTL

### Future Extension

- AODV / OLSR concepts

### Extra Lab: Disaster Response Mesh

Nodes form a temporary rescue network.

## WEEK 7 – Store-and-Forward Communication

### Overview
When links fail, memory becomes the network.
### Learning Outcomes

- Implement message queues
- Retry logic

### Basic Lab

- Detect link availability
- Store messages
- Forward later

### Future Extension

- Persistent storage

### Extra Lab: Planetary Email System

Messages arrive minutes later. Students wait. Philosophically.

## WEEK 8 – Opportunistic Routing

### Overview
Forward packets based on probability, not certainty.
### Learning Outcomes

- Decision-based forwarding
- Encounter-based routing

### Basic Lab

- Maintain delivery probability
- Forward when advantageous

### Future Extension

- Epidemic routing

### Extra Lab: Wildlife Tracking Network

Mobile nodes exchange data when paths cross.

## WEEK 9 – Bio-Inspired Networking

### Overview
Ants route better than we do. Deal with it.
### Learning Outcomes

- Reinforcement routing
- Adaptive path selection

### Basic Lab

Simulate pheromone-based routing tables.

### Extra Lab

Self-healing network simulation.

## WEEK 10 – Quantum-Inspired Networking (Conceptual)

### Overview
No quantum hardware. Still quantum thinking.
### Learning Outcomes

- No-cloning constraint
- State collapse modeling

### Basic Lab

One-time-read message tokens.

### Extra Lab

Quantum-secure messenger simulation.

## Capstone Options
Disaster Mesh Network
Bio-routing Simulator
Delay-Tolerant Space Network

Final Note to Students
If your program never fails, it’s lying.
