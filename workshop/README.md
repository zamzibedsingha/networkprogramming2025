# Python Network Programming 2025 – Course Syllabus

**Course Code**: NETPROG-2025  
**Instructor**: Network Programming Team  
**Semester**: 2025 (10 weeks)  
**Location**: Lab-based (distributed)  
**Prerequisite**: Basic Python programming, understanding of IP/routing concepts

---

## Course Description

An intensive, lab-based course in **socket programming and network behavior**. Students build one fundamental network pattern each week, progressing from classical TCP client-server to futures like quantum-inspired communication.

This is not a networking theory course. This is a **programming course** where the subject is networks.

### Core Philosophy

> **Networks are not cables and boxes. They are agreements under uncertainty.**

Each week, students implement one agreement—simple first, fragile second, strange third. By the end, you will have built a complete spectrum of network behaviors: reliable, unreliable, direct, broadcast, peer, ad-hoc, store-and-forward, opportunistic, bio-inspired, and quantum-friendly.

## Getting Help

### Debugging Resources
1. **Read the error message carefully** (90% of issues are in the output)
2. **Check preconditions**: Port in use? Peer running? Firewall?
3. **Add print statements** to trace execution
4. **Use Wireshark** to see actual packets
5. **Ask instructor/peers** after 15 minutes of independent effort

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|---|---|
| "Address already in use" | Previous server didn't close | `SO_REUSEADDR` or wait 60s |
| "Connection refused" | Target peer not running | Start both/all endpoints |
| "recv() blocks forever" | Peer sent nothing or disconnected | Add timeout; check peer state |
| "Encoding error" | String ↔ bytes mismatch | `.encode()` / `.decode()` |
| "Socket timeout" | Network slow or unreachable | Increase timeout; check connectivity |

## Course Philosophy (Expanded)

> **If your program never fails, it's lying.**

Networks are inherently uncertain:
- **Links fail** (bits flip, packets drop, routers crash)
- **Hosts disappear** (mobility, power loss, deployment end)
- **Timing is weird** (variable latency, reordering, retransmission)

Classical education teaches reliability. This course teaches **resilience**:
- Acknowledge failure
- Communicate despite it
- Recover gracefully

By week 7, you've built:
1. ✅ Guaranteed delivery (TCP)
2. ✅ Loss tolerance (UDP)
3. ✅ One-to-many delivery (broadcast/multicast)
4. ✅ Decentralized communication (P2P)
5. ✅ Dynamic routing (MANET)
6. ✅ Delayed delivery (store-and-forward)

Weeks 8-10 teach the future:
7. 🔮 Smart routing (opportunistic)
8. 🧬 Biological intelligence (bio-inspired)
9. ⚛️ Quantum principles (quantum-inspired)

---

## Final Words

You are not learning *networking theory*. You are learning to **program networks**.

Each week, you build something that works. Each week, it gets stranger. By the end, you will have hands-on experience with concepts researchers are still inventing.

Don't rush past any week. If you skip the fundamentals, later weeks won't make sense. **Network programming is cumulative.**

And remember: The network is not against you. It's just indifferent. Program accordingly.

**Time**: 10 weeks, 6-8 hrs/week

Good luck. May your packets arrive.
